Database
  - There are therr tables:
      - admin: id, username, password
      - teachers: id, name, designation, joining date, email, country, others
      - basicinfo: id, schoolname, moto, estdate, hpname, about, contact, server, user, pass, dbName;
Setup myProject:
  - Copy the mysite folder into ../xampp/htdocs/
  - Run xampp server
  - Open a browser and visti â€œlocalhost/YOURFOLDERNAME/install/install.php
  - Delete install directory from ../xampp/htdocs/YOURFOLDERNAME/
  - Now visit my site: localhost/YOURFOLDERNAME
  - Admin default login information: username: admin and password: admin

Future Planning:
  - We can add individual teacher id

  - Teacher individually update their data
  - Design password recovery system
