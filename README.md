# School_website
Design a school or college website


Database
  - There are two tables:
      - admin: id, username, password
      - teachers: id, name, designation, joining date, email, country, others

Setup myProject:
  - Copy the mysite folder into ../xampp/htdocs/
  - Run xampp server
  - Open a browser and visti â€œlocalhost/mysite/install/install.php
  - Delete install directory from ../xampp/htdocs/mysite/
  - Now visit my site: localhost/mysite
  - Admin default login information: username: admin and password: admin

Future Planning:
  - We can add individual teacher id
  - Teacher Login
  - Teacher individually update their data
  - Design password recovery system
  - And so on.
